# Chitter-Redux

## Done list:
-created login page html/css
- created home page html/css
- created get/post backend 
- express validation on posted data
- created peeps as cards which appear as posted
- created modal which gives update whether peep was posted successfully 
- created scroll bar so peeps don't take up the entire page

## Current To-do list: 

- Need to fix the css/bootstrap responsiveness because components squash together when the screen is not full size
- Add front-end validation to the front-end peeps
- Start login and authentication using JWT tokens and Bcrypt (next)
- Create register page and add authentication to it (next)
